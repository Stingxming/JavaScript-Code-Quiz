# JavaScript-Code-Quiz

I have to submit this incomplete because I'm still working on it. Eventually I will have a multiple choice quiz built in HTML with interactive logic in javaScript. My next submission of this assignment will be much further along. I spent hours finishing up with week 4 mini project instead of working on this challenge because I felt like I needed the practice and to try to gain a better understanding of the challenge.
